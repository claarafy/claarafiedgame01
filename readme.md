#Project 01: 
##$('body').append(whoYouAre) 

Games, nowadays, are more than just entertainment. Scope of games has expanded so much to a point where it blurs the line between  reality and virtuality. For me, memories of the games I played have been terminated a while ago. So, I figured I should recreate those lost memories by building this game. 

__Game Introduction:__ <br>

This game requires 2 players, a little bit of memory and quick-action. When the game begins, a picture of one character (drawn by me...) will be exposed to both characters for 3 seconds. Within that 3 seconds, both players have to remember as much as possible about the character, which will mostly be regarding attire for this version. 

The picture will vanish, and the game will be followed by 6 different rounds. In each round, the chosen player (player's turn will be announced on the top of the page each round) needs to click on the correct item out of one's memory. 

__Score:__ <br>

If correct, score goes up by 1. If incorrect, drops by 2. Players will have an access to their scores each round, but also the final score will be shown on the scoreboard during the last bit of the game.

__Development & Technologies:__ <br>

Built on HTML, CSS, majorly jQuery and a bit of javaScript.

__Need-to-be-solved:__ <br>

I've encountered various errors throughout this project; some solved, some left unsolved. I'll need to add more variety to the solutions of the game, so it's actually sustainable. Appropriate switch between players and more styling needs to be done.
